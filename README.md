Improving my Front-End Development skills through The Odin Project foundations course by implementing this website in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I've also used items from Kevin Powell, Andy Bell's CSS Reset template, and things I've learned from a multitude of sources, so thank you for all the help!
